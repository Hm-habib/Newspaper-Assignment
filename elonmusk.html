    <p>According to the Forbes report, at the moment, Musk's total assets are 340 billion dollars, that is, more than 34 billion dollars, which economic experts believe is a record in the history of the world.

        Musk played an important role in the US presidential election . He spent about 200 million dollars from his own pocket to win Trump. 
        
        It is reported that in the last 20 days, another 70 billion dollars have been added to Musk's assets. Which is more than the GDP of Myanmar. Some economists claim that no one has ever been so rich in the history of the world. 
        
        
        Musk's company Tesla and X are catching up to AI's breakneck pace. On November 22, his net worth exceeded $340 billion. Analysts say that Trump's victory has brought Musk so much wealth. 
        
        According to the report of Forbes, the market value of XAI has increased to 50 billion in the last few weeks. Mask has 60 percent share in this company. Space research firm Space-X is also in a profitable position. Mask's share is 42 percent. The market value of this company is 210 billion dollars. And Musk has 13 percent shares in Tesla.
        
        Musk is currently at the top of the list of the richest people in the world. Second is Larry Ellison, third is Jeff Bezos, fourth is Mark Zuckerberg and fifth is Bernard Arno and family. 
        
        
        However, it should be noted here that the difference between Musk's property and Larry, who is ranked second in the list of the world's richest people, is about 80 billion dollars.</p>
