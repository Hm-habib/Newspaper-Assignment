    <p>'No need to call me sir, I am your brother. We will move forward together shoulder to shoulder like a mass uprising. If you make a mistake, correct it. If the nation needs it, we will take to the streets again.'In the closing ceremony of the 11th GSC National Scientist Mania at the Government Science College in Dhaka, the chief guest said this while addressing the students of the college. Nahid Islam.

        The advisor also thanked the students of Government Science College for their participation and sacrifice in the July uprising. 
        
        He said, Jen-Ji has shown the world that they can liberate the country from dictatorship with their blood in the movement and struggle, they are not lazy. 
        
        
        The advisor said, we have to do the work so that every people of Bangladesh gets the benefits of the July uprising. We hope that the expectation for which everyone has protested and given blood will be fulfilled. The July uprising taught us to stand with dignity. We can build Bangladesh anew with this confidence.  Nahid Islam said, students are being deliberately tried to be controversial. Let us all be aware of this and behave responsibly. Disputes, conflicts among students are helping to present students negatively to the countrymen. If the students can be portrayed negatively, it will be easy to portray the July coup in a negative way. No one can take this opportunity. We have protested for so long, stayed on the streets, it is time for us to form a state. We now have to use intelligence, use creativity. 

        He also commented that the families of the martyrs will be rehabilitated and the injured will be treated, besides giving state honors to the martyrs and injured of the July uprising. 
        
        By the way, advisor said. Nahid Islam is a former student of Government Science College. </p>
