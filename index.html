                    'Mahti Sadhusang and Lalan Mela' has been closed due to the objection of Hefazate Islam and local
                    Muslims. The event was supposed to be held on Friday and Saturday but in the end the fair was
                    canceled due to lack of permission from the district administration.

                    Lalan devotees from different parts of the country including Kushtia came to participate in this
                    fair but in the end everyone had to go back.

                    Organizer Fakir Shahjalal told BBC Bangla that this fair and event has been organized regularly for
                    the past ten years.

                    Mr. Shahjalal told BBC Bangla, "Such a common event has been stopped today due to security and local
                    worshipers. Not only closed, but I am also under threat".</marquee>

            <p>Interim government economic adviser. Saleh Uddin Ahmed said, Europe has many monstrous rivers, starting
                from Germany and ending in the Netherlands. Ships move in them. There may have been political issues in
                themselves but the principle of sharing river water was there. India has no reason not to give us water.
                India has to press on it. He said this while addressing the chief guest at the seminar titled 'Upstream
                Joint River Water Withdrawal: Economic Disaster of Bangladesh' organized by the International Farakka
                Committee, Bangladesh at the Abdus Salam Hall of the National Press Club on Saturday (November 23).

                Dr. Saleh Uddin Ahmed said, India has no reason not to give us water. It has to be pressed. India needs
                political and social pressure to get its fair share of water.

                He said, when there is water pressure in India, we open the sluice gates here. Again they close the
                sluice gates when there is shortage of water. They are doing it at will, that's why we are not getting
                water. This is causing problems in our farming. Day by day becomes like a desert.


                He also said that the work we are doing is very challenging. They need people's support. We will work to
                ensure that not only Farakka, but also the 54 rivers that have a fair share of water.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color: darkgray;">The editor of New Age called Joy's claim as propaganda</h2>

            <p>Nurul Kabir, editor of New Age newspaper, termed the allegation made by former Prime Minister Sheikh
                Hasina's son Sajib Wazed Joy in a Facebook post as completely baseless and false. He also commented that
                it is nothing but an unreasonable and untrue campaign.Nurul Kabir made this comment in a post on his
                verified Facebook page on Saturday (November 23).

                In a post from Joy's verified Facebook page on November 16, it was claimed that Dr. The Yunus-led
                interim government pressured New Age editor Nurul Kabir to remove a news story.

                The post mentions that the New Age, in a report published on November 16, said that eight people had
                been extrajudicially killed in the first 52 days of the current government and that report was withdrawn
                under pressure.


                In response to Joy's allegation, New Age editor clearly stated in his Facebook post, 'This is a baseless
                and false allegation. No government agency directed me or New Age to remove this report and we did not
                remove the story.'Nurul Kabir also said, 'Mr. Sajib Wazed Joy may not know or did not try to know that
                even Dr. Even if the Yunus administration requested us to remove the news, we would not have done so.
                New Age has always been known for independent journalism and we have never bowed down to any government.
                Not even during his mother's reign'.

                The New Age editor also said, 'Our newspaper has always placed great value on ethics and professional
                integrity. No past government could deviate us from this integrity. So this claim of victory is nothing
                but an absurd and untrue campaign'.

                After such comments, the continuity of independent journalism of New Age and its editor Nurul Kabir has
                once again come into discussion. It has also given a fresh look at the context of media freedom in the
                current political context of Bangladesh. </p>
